# Draft Mode

The package provides a streamlined way to implement Sanity's draft mode in Next.js App Router projects.

## Setup

The draft mode handler is automatically configured when you initialize Sanity with a token (via the `SANITY_API_TOKEN` environment variable).

## Usage

Create your draft mode API route with a single line:

```tsx
// app/api/draft/route.ts
export {defineEnableDraftMode as GET} from "@/data/sanity/client";
```

That's it! The `defineEnableDraftMode` handler:

- Is always defined (no TypeScript errors about undefined values)
- Automatically uses the token from your initialization
- Returns helpful error messages if not properly configured
- Handles all the draft mode setup internally
