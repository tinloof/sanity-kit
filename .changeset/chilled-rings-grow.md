Add `definePage` and `defineSchema` utilities to simplify document schema creation with built-in common fields and configurations.

### New utilities:

- **`definePage`**: Creates page document schemas with automatic pathname, SEO, and indexable fields. Supports internationalization, creation disabling, and custom field grouping.

- **`defineSchema`**: Creates document schemas with automatic internal title, locale fields (for i18n), and orderable document list support. Includes content and settings field groups by default.
