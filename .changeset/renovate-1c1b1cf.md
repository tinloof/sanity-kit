**BREAKING CHANGE**: Updated peer dependencies to require Sanity v5, React 19.2.3+, Next.js 16.0.10+, and next-sanity v12.

These minimum versions are required due to:
- Sanity v5 dropping support for React < 19.2
- next-sanity v12 requiring Next.js 16 and React 19.2
- Critical security vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-55182, CVE-2025-67779) in earlier versions of React and Next.js
